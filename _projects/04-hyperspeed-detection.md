excerpt: "Constructed an algorithm framework using an improved YOLOv5s model and deployed it on an Nvidia Jetson Nano."
---

* Constructed an algorithm framework using an improved YOLOv5s model as the core algorithm, complemented by a developed difference value hashing pooling algorithm.
* Developed the front end using PySide6 and QSS and processed the dataset using the Roboflow platform.
* Leveraged the edge computing approach to build a comprehensive edge computing system on devices like Nvidia Jetson Nano to enable efficient software execution.
