**Abstract:**
We present 2SDS (Scene Separation and Data Selection algorithm), a temporal segmentation algorithm used in real-time video stream interpretation. It complements CNN-based models to make use of temporal information in videos. 2SDS can detect the change between scenes in a video stream by com-paring the image difference between two frames. It separates a video into segments (scenes), and by combining itself with a CNN model, 2SDS can select the optimal result for each scene. In this paper, we will be discussing some basic methods and concepts behind 2SDS, as well as presenting some preliminary experiment results regarding 2SDS. During these experiments, 2SDS has achieved an overall accuracy of over 90%.
