* Developed and curated **multimodal reasoning datasets** for **LLM instruction tuning**, focusing on graph problems. Designed and integrated graph-based visuals to align with textual reasoning tasks.
* Authored **step-by-step reasoning annotations** that model human problem-solving processes, illustrating intermediate states, algorithmic invariants, and detailed solution logic for each problem.
* Improved LLMs’ **algorithmic reasoning** performance through expert validation and dataset refinement.
