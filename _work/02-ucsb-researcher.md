* Spearheaded research on **Trustworthy AI**, focusing on mitigating object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) through both internal attention intervention and external decoding strategies.
* Proposed **VEGAS**, an adaptive steering mechanism that calibrates visual attention weights during inference. Achieved a **20-point CHAIR improvement** by suppressing linguistic priors.
* Developed **SDCD**, a contrastive decoding framework that isolates structural biases via spatially shuffled negative views, achieving a **6% F1 score improvement** on the POPE benchmark.
* Currently conducting research on **AI Agents**.
