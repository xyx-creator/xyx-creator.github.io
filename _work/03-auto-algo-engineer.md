---

* Designed and developed the **TDOA** (Time Difference of Arrival) localization algorithm, which precisely located signal sources in urban environments using a multi-sensor network.
* Used MATLAB for comprehensive simulation validation and employed C++ for field test implementation, achieving critical technological breakthroughs from theory to practical application.
* Ensured **5 m localization accuracy** in simulations for sensor distances over 2 km, and achieved **23 m drone signal localization accuracy** in field tests.
