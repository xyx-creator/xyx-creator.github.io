---

* Designed and developed the TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) localization algorithm, which precisely located signal sources in urban environments using a multi-sensor network.
* Used MATLAB for comprehensive simulation validation and employed C++ for field test implementation, achieving critical technological breakthroughs from theory to practical application.
* In configurations with sensor distances exceeding 2 kilometers, meticulous simulation adjustments ensured that the average localization error remained within 5 meters in simulations.
* Field tests successfully limited drone signal localization errors to within 23 meters.
