## Hi there👋! I’m **Yuxuan Xia**

I’m a Master's student in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where I work with [Prof. Peng Li](https://web.ece.ucsb.edu/~lip/). I received my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science through a joint program between Southwest Jiaotong University and the University of Leeds, graduating with First Class Honours from the University of Leeds.

**Next Step:** In Fall 2026, I will join the ND-VIS Lab at the University of Notre Dame as a Ph.D. student, advised by [Prof. Chaoli Wang](https://sites.nd.edu/chaoli-wang/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Computer Vision** and **Natural Language Processing**, with a particular focus on **Vision-Language Models** and **Visualization**. I develop trustworthy multimodal systems that make complex visual-linguistic reasoning more intuitive, expressive, and accessible to broader audiences. A key part of my current work involves mitigating hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by building attention-calibration mechanisms and contrastive-decoding frameworks.

More broadly, I’m excited about **AI + VIS**.

If you’re interested in my work or would like to collaborate, feel free to reach out at [yxia6@nd.edu](mailto:yxia6@nd.edu).
